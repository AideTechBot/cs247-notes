**Problem:** want to vary algorithm at runtime.


**Solution:** encapsulate the algorithm decision in an object hierarchy, specialize with overrides.

- class hierarchy as shown
- class hierarchy of function objects 
- Non-OOP solution using function pointers

## Measures of Design Quality
### Coupling and Cohesion
**Coupling:** the degree to which distinct modules interact/depend on eachother
